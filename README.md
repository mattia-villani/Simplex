# Simplex
Python implementation to resolve a simplex problem. 
The mothod implemented is the tableau and a step by step output is provided
The simplex problem model is 
  min f * x;
  A * x <= b;
  x >= 0 ;
where x is a vector of size m, as it is f which rapresent the function to minimize.
A instead is the coeficient matrix of m x n. b is the vector of the known coefs and it has size m
